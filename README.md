## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, it's me Omsin!
### I am a 19 years old student currently living in Thailand. I love coding and engineering-related tasks.
My projects on GitHub are mostly for my friends or personal use, do not expect them to be bug-free haha

Personal GitLab (for dotfile and private stuff): https://gitlab.com/OmsinKrissada
