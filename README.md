## üëã Hello, it's me Omsin!
### I am a 19 years old student currently living in Thailand. I love coding and engineering-related tasks.
My projects on GitHub are mostly for my friends or personal use, do not expect them to be bug-free haha

Personal GitLab (for dotfile and more private stuff): https://gitlab.com/OmsinKrissada
Also migrating some frequently accessed projects to https://git.krissada.com

Quick access to some of the websites I made:
- [ASCLEPIUS team in Microsoft AI for Accessibility Hackathon APAC 2022](https://asclepius.krissada.com/)
- [Wynncraft Guild Dashboard (for Calvish)](https://calvish-guild.vercel.app/weekly/)
- [Self-learning resources](https://resources.krissada.com/)
- [Ruby team demo website for Thinc. 10-Days Project 2023](https://chata.krissada.com/)

## üñ•Ô∏è My Workstation Setup
A laptop running a dual-boot setup (Arch + Windows 11). And a home server to run my side hussles.

My Windows 11 Setup:
- It's Windows üòë
  
My Arch setup:
- Running the Zen kernel with NVIDIA DKMS 'cause I use NVIDIA
- GNOME & Hyprland (with wofi and waybar) for DM/WM, accessed from GDM
- zsh for shell (with p10k), and GNOME Terminal for terminal
- Currently using ext4 but may try btrfs one day...

Home server:
- Ubuntu 22.04.4... that's it! Nothing else to say in particular.
